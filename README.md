# Veyra Protocol

AI-powered yield strategies on Sonic. Vaults allocate capital across modular strategy components (lending, DEX, staking, etc.), and off-chain services read a unified components-based introspection to report metrics.

## Features
- ERC-4626 vaults with multiple strategies
- Components-based strategy introspection (`components()`)
- Sonic integrations: Aave (lending), Rings, Eggs, Shadow, BEETS, SwapX, Pendle
- Optional analytics/indexing and rebalancing services

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (`/server`)
- Fastify TypeScript API
- Reads `IStrategyIntrospection.components()` and queries adapters for metrics
- Optional analytics and rebalancing services

### Smart Contracts (`/contracts`)
- VeyraVault: ERC-4626 vault with strategy management
- Strategies implementing `IStrategyIntrospection.components()`
- Adapter interfaces for lending/DEX/staking protocols

### Frontend (`/web`)
- **Next.js** React application with modern UI/UX
- **RainbowKit** wallet integration for Sonic network
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live yield tracking, portfolio metrics, and analytics
- **Strategy Insights**: AI-generated market insights and recommendations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Foundry for smart contract development
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd veyra
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../web
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Smart Contract Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../contracts
   forge install
   # This installs dependencies locally to contracts/lib/
   # All dependencies are self-contained within the contracts/ directory
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Backend env (`server/.env`)
   ```env
   PORT=8080
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   SONIC_RPC_URL=wss://sonic-rpc.publicnode.com
   ```

2. Frontend env (`web/.env.local`)
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Contracts env (`contracts/.env`)
   ```env
   SONIC_RPC_URL=wss://sonic-rpc.publicnode.com
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

### Development

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   forge build
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd server && npm test
   
   # Contract tests
   cd contracts && forge test
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd web && npm test
   ```

### Deployment
- Contracts: see `contracts/README.md` (includes a one-command deploy + address update helper)
- Server: `npm run build && npm start`
- Web: `npm run build && npm start`

## Supported Protocols (Sonic)
- Lending: Aave (via adapter)
- DEX: Shadow, BEETS, SwapX
- Yield/Derivatives: Rings, Eggs, Pendle
