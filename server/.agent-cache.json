It provides excellent diversification as a straightforward LP strategy, balancing the portfolio against more complex strategies.\n\n3. **Eggs x Shadow Loop (30% allocation)**: Despite the same 5.00% APY as the StS strategy, this leveraged loop strategy adds valuable diversification through its different risk profile and yield generation mechanism. The low complexity score (0.20/1.0) and zero risk factors make it attractive for portfolio balance.\n\nThe current allocation already optimizes for:\n- Risk diversification across different strategy types (LP, managed range, leveraged loop)\n- Balanced complexity exposure (all strategies at 0.20/1.0)\n- No concentration risk in any single strategy\n- Maximized yield while maintaining conservative risk profile\n\nGiven that all strategies show zero risk factors and similar complexity scores, the slight APY advantage of SwapX justifies its larger allocation.
