/**
 * Multicall3 Utilities - Making Blockchain Calls Super Efficient! ðŸš€
 * ===================================================================
 * 
 * PROBLEM: Imagine you want to check the APY of 5 different strategies.
 * Without multicall, you'd make 5 separate blockchain calls:
 * - Call strategy1.apy() â†’ wait for response
 * - Call strategy2.apy() â†’ wait for response  
 * - Call strategy3.apy() â†’ wait for response
 * - Call strategy4.apy() â†’ wait for response
 * - Call strategy5.apy() â†’ wait for response
 * Total time: 5 x network delay = SLOW! ðŸ˜´
 *
 * SOLUTION: Multicall3 lets us bundle all 5 calls into ONE blockchain request:
 * - Send [strategy1.apy(), strategy2.apy(), strategy3.apy(), strategy4.apy(), strategy5.apy()]
 * - Get back [result1, result2, result3, result4, result5] in one response
 * Total time: 1 x network delay = FAST! âš¡
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. We prepare each function call by encoding it into raw bytes (like packing a suitcase)
 * 2. We send all encoded calls to the Multicall3 contract on the blockchain
 * 3. Multicall3 executes each call and collects all the results
 * 4. We unpack the results and convert them back into readable values
 *
 * This is especially useful for our vault service because we need to check:
 * - Multiple strategy APYs
 * - Multiple strategy allocations  
 * - Multiple adapter states
 * All at once, instead of making dozens of separate calls!

 * - If one call fails (maybe a strategy doesn't exist), we still get results from the others
 * - Instead of the whole batch failing, we just mark that one call as failed
 * - This prevents one bad strategy from breaking our entire data fetch!
 *

 * - name: The friendly label we gave this call
 * - success: Did this specific call work?
 * - returnData: The raw result (still needs to be decoded)
